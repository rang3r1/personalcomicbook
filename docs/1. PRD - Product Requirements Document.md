- **Database**: Use **Supabase** for database management to handle user data, subscriptions, comic generation settings, and content. Supabase offers seamless integration with Vercel and provides real-time capabilities for user interactions.
- **API Integrations**:
    - **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Integrate ChatGPT for generating or refining user storylines and character descriptions.
    - **Midjourney API**: Use Midjourney for comic-style image generation. Midjourney’s API will manage image rendering, and API calls will be made based on the user’s selected art style and character inputs.
    - **Stripe**: Integrate Stripe for secure handling of subscription payments, supporting multiple pricing tiers and transaction types (one-time or recurring).
    - **OAuth / Google Single Sign-On**: Enable Google Sign-In for streamlined account creation and login. Implement additional OAuth providers as needed to increase accessibility.

### 5.2 **Frontend Framework**

- **UI Framework**: Build the frontend using **Next.js** (optimized for Vercel) for a seamless, server-side rendered experience, contributing to faster page loads and smoother interactivity.
- **User Interface**: Create a responsive and intuitive user interface that guides users through the comic creation process with minimal technical knowledge required.

### 5.3 **Data Flow & Processing**

- **Prompt Handling**: Pass user input to OpenAI’s API to generate storyline text or descriptions of characters. This output will guide Midjourney in rendering comic panels with consistent style and character detail.
- **Session Management**: Store comic session data in Supabase, allowing users to save progress and continue editing. This also enables multi-session project management if needed in future releases.

### 5.4 **Performance Optimization**

- **Caching**: Use Vercel’s built-in caching features to store frequently used assets and deliver them with minimal latency.
- **Image Processing**: Optimize and compress images generated by Midjourney to minimize loading times while retaining visual quality. Store images temporarily in Supabase, with a longer-term storage solution for user projects.

### 5.5 **Security and Compliance**

- **Data Privacy**: Adhere to GDPR and data security protocols, ensuring all user data and content generated is securely managed.
