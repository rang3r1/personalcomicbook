## Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

### 1. **Overview**

The AI Comic Generator WebApp is a platform for users to create AI-generated comics using their own storylines, characters, and chosen comic styles. It integrates various APIs (OpenAI ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stripe, and Google OAuth) and utilizes Vercel for deployment with Supabase as the database.

### 2. **Functional Components (Based on Workflow Image)**

#### **Product Management Layer**

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Outline high-level requirements for creating AI-generated comics, including features, goals, and target audiences.
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**: Design the relationships between different entities such as User, Project, Character, Storyline, and Comic Style.
- **FRD (Functional Requirements Document)**: This document defines the core functionalities and user workflows in detail.

#### **DB Layer**

- **Schemas**: Define database tables and relationships based on the data models identified in the ERD.
- **SQL Commands**: Includes commands for table creation, seeding data, and initializing required relationships between tables.

#### **Server/API Layer**

- **Define OpenAPI and AsyncAPI**: Set up OpenAPI specifications for API endpoints, including endpoints for generating text (ChatGPT) and images (Midjourney). Define async operations as needed for image processing and payments.
- **Backend Server**: Implement server logic to handle user requests and data processing, interacting with Supabase, external APIs, and the frontend.

#### **Web App Layer**

- **UX Sitemap and Structure**: Map out the main pages and flows (e.g., login, project creation, character setup, style selection, panel generation, and export/download).
- **React Store and Root**: Use React to manage state and render the UI, handling data from the server and user interactions.
- **Views and Layouts**: Define views and layouts for creating and editing comics, including a project dashboard, character editor, and style selector.
- **Review and Generate**: Implement logic to generate or refresh comic panels, allowing users to review and redesign individual views if needed.

### 3. **Key Functionalities**

#### 3.1 **User Management**

- **Sign-Up/Login**: Users can sign up or log in using Google OAuth.
- **Subscription Management**: Stripe integration to handle payment processing and manage different subscription tiers.

#### 3.2 **Project Creation and Management**

- **Project Setup**: Users can create new projects by specifying a description and uploading any attachments or reference material.
- **Storyline Input**: Users enter or generate a storyline using OpenAI ChatGPT.
- **Character Customization**: Users define character traits for consistency in panel generation.

#### 3.3 **Comic Generation**

- **Style Selection**: Users can select a comic style from available options (e.g., manga, superhero).
- **Panel Consistency**: Midjourneyâ€™s API processes images with guidance from text inputs, producing consistent comic panels across frames.
- **Review and Editing**: Users can view generated panels and request updates if adjustments are needed.

#### 3.4 **Export Options**

- **Export Formats**: Users can download comics in multiple formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PDF).
- **Panel-by-Panel Export**: Option for exporting individual panels for further editing.
