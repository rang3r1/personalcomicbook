## Database Requirements Document (DRD)

Based on the FRD, here are the database requirements and suggested schema for Supabase.

### 1. **Tables and Entities**

#### **1.1 Users**

- **Fields**:
    - `user_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `email` (String, unique)
    - `password` (String, hashed)
    - `oauth_provider` (String, e.g., "Google")
    - `subscription_level` (String, e.g., "Free", "Basic", "Pro")
    - `created_at` (Timestamp)

#### **1.2 Projects**

- **Fields**:
    - `project_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    - `description` (Text)
    - `created_at` (Timestamp)
    - `updated_at` (Timestamp)
- **Relationships**:
    - One-to-many relationship with **Users** (one user can have multiple projects).

#### **1.3 Characters**

- **Fields**:
    - `character_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
    - `name` (String)
    - `traits` (JSON, for character attributes like color, appearance)
- **Relationships**:
    - Many-to-one relationship with **Projects** (a project can have multiple characters).

#### **1.4 Comic Styles**

- **Fields**:
    - `style_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `name` (String, e.g., "Manga", "Superhero")
    - `description` (Text)
- **Relationships**:
    - Many-to-many relationship with **Projects** (a project can have multiple styles).

#### **1.5 Panels**

- **Fields**:
    - `panel_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
    - `character_id` (Foreign Key to Characters, nullable if panel doesnâ€™t include a specific character)
    - `style_id` (Foreign Key to Comic Styles)
    - `image_url` (String, URL to generated image)
    - `order` (Integer, to define panel sequence)
- **Relationships**:
    - Many-to-one relationship with **Projects** and **Comic Styles**.

#### **1.6 Payments**

- **Fields**:
    - `payment_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    - `amount` (Decimal)
    - `currency` (String)
    - `status` (String, e.g., "Completed", "Pending")
    - `payment_date` (Timestamp)
- **Relationships**:
    - Many-to-one relationship with **Users**.

### 2. **Relationships and Indexes**

- **Indexes**:
    - Index on `email` in **Users** for faster authentication.
    - Composite index on `project_id` and `order` in **Panels** for efficient retrieval in panel order.
- **Relationships**:
    - Foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity between **Users**, **Projects**, **Characters**, **Comic Styles**, and **Panels**.

### 3. **Data Integrity and Constraints**

- **Cascade Deletion**: When a project is deleted, all associated characters and panels should be deleted to maintain database integrity.
- **Unique Constraints**: Ensure unique constraint on the `email` field in **Users**.

### 4. **Sample SQL Commands**
